# Beyond Frontier Action Distillation: Verifier-Guided Training for Small Agentic Models
## 📖 Overview

SARL trains language-model agents to act strategically across cooperative and competitive games. The repository provides the complete pipeline for preparing preference data, training Qwen2.5-3B LoRA adapters with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and reproducing Tables 1–7.

The pipeline includes three stages:

1. **Preference Data Construction:** Merge, deduplicate, and deterministically sample game trajectories into six training datasets.
2. **Strategic Agent Training:** Train six DPO/LoRA variants and construct a merged adapter.
3. **Game Evaluation:** Evaluate in-distribution and held-out strategic games using the paper protocol.

### 🎮 Featured Games

- **Social dilemmas:** Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt
- **Coordination and competition:** Battle of the Sexes and Matching Pennies
- **Sequential interaction:** Negotiation and Tic-Tac-Toe
- **Held-out games:** Auction, Divide-the-Dollar, Beauty Contest, and one-stage IPD

## 🚀 Method

SARL uses preference pairs of the form `prompt / chosen / rejected` to optimize a 4-bit Qwen2.5-3B base model with DPO. The paper protocol trains the following variants:

The teacher is the oracle policy that produces preferred responses. The student is both the blind rollout policy and the model updated by LoRA/DPO; no separate blind-model setting is used.

| Variant | Training pairs | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `filter_on` | 388 | Filtered preference data |
| `filter_off` | 407 | Unfiltered preference data |
| `core` | 503 | Core A+β subset |
| `aux` | 613 | Auxiliary A+β subset |
| `all` | 1,338 | Full A+β set |
| `rw` | 1,749 | Reward-weighted extension |
| `merge` | — | Equal-weight merge of `aux` and `all` |

## 🛠️ Installation

The project requires Python 3.10 or newer, an NVIDIA GPU, and CUDA 12.6. On the UMass cluster, create the environment once:

```bash
module load conda/latest cuda/12.6
conda create -n sal python=3.11 -y
conda activate sal

pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Set HF_TOKEN in .env.
```

The Hugging Face account must have access to `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`. The train and eval entrypoints load CUDA, Conda, and `.env` automatically.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All hyperparameters are managed in `.env`; training and evaluation commands need no arguments. The main settings are:

```dotenv
STUDENT_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
TEACHER_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct

TRAIN_MAX_STEPS=100
TRAIN_EPOCHS=10
LEARNING_RATE=5e-5
DPO_BETA=0.1
LORA_R=16
LORA_ALPHA=32
LORA_DROPOUT=0.05
LORA_TARGET=all-linear
MAX_LENGTH=12288
TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE=1
GRAD_ACCUM=8
WARMUP_RATIO=0.05
LR_SCHEDULER=cosine
LOGGING_STEPS=10
SAVE_STEPS=20
SAVE_TOTAL_LIMIT=100

EVAL_EPISODES=12
EVAL_SEED=42
EVAL_MAX_TOKENS=192
EVAL_VARIANTS=base,core
EVAL_GAMES=all
MERGE_ALPHA=0.5
```

`TRAIN_MAX_STEPS` takes precedence over `TRAIN_EPOCHS`. Leave it empty to train by epoch. See [.env.example](.env.example) for quantization, precision, CUDA, and cache settings.

---

## ⚡ Training

Prepared preference datasets must exist under `data/paper/`.

```bash
./lora/train.sh
```

This trains all six variants, creates the merged adapter, and stores everything in a new `runs/<session-id>/lora/` directory. Every setting is read from `.env`.

### Monitoring

Track training with TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs --port 6006
```

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

After training finishes, run:

```bash
./eval/eval.sh
```

This automatically evaluates the latest training session in paper mode. Model, variants, games, episode count, seed, generation length, LoRA settings, and merge weight are read from `.env`. Results are written under `runs/<session-id>/eval/`.

For the separate 1,000-episode robustness protocol, see [Extended Evaluation](eval/EXTENDED_EVAL.md).

---

## 📊 Outputs

All artifacts from one experiment share a session directory:

```text
runs/<session-id>/
├── lora/
│   ├── filter_on/
│   ├── filter_off/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── aux/
│   ├── all/
│   ├── rw/
│   └── merge/
└── eval/
    ├── staging/
    ├── tables/
    ├── metrics/
    ├── logs/
    ├── result.md
    └── latex.md
```

Each trainable variant stores its resumable checkpoints under `adapter/checkpoint-*`. `runs/latest.json` points to the most recently completed training session.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- For `AutoProcessor`, Torch, or TorchVision import errors, reinstall the matched Torch/TorchVision versions listed above.
- For Hugging Face HTTP 401/403 errors, verify `HF_TOKEN` in `.env` and confirm model-license access.
